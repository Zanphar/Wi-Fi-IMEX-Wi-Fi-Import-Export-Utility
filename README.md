# Wi-Fi-IMEX-Wi-Fi-Import-Export-Utility

This was a little idea created many years ago, which I decided earlier today to 
re-create it again because I wanted to install my Wi-Fi settings on to another 
computer, and also to have a backup (if for any reason,) I could retrieve them 
if something unknown should happen.

# Reason for this?
I've noticed a few people on the internet expressing an interest for something 
similar to this, so I figured why not? Also, three nice things about this:

 1. The code (if you want to call it that,) is completely viewable.
 2. It's completely free, to download, use, build on, etc.
 3. It gets the job done easily, effortlessly, and quickly.

# Brief disclaimer and reason
 However, this is all provided "as-is" without any guarantee or warranty 
 whether express or implied. While you may use this, it is at your own 
 risk as everyone's systems and setups are differently, so please review 
 the code carefully before using.
